# Full Stack User App

Welcome to the Full Stack User App project! This is a simple web application built using Vue.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Axios.

## Project Overview

This project consists of a user management system where users can be stored in a database and retrieved through a web interface. The project is divided into two main components: the frontend and the backend.

- Frontend: The user interface is built using Vue.js. It allows users to interact with the application, view user data, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user records.

- Backend: The server-side logic is implemented using Node.js and Express. It provides API endpoints for handling user data, communicates with the MongoDB database, and handles HTTP requests from the frontend.
